        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <p>
            I used to learn things I <em>like</em> (mostly programming languages and web development) from online courses. The main problem I encountered was that they always reviewed the basics. I mean every-single-course taught the same stuff. <a href="...">hahaha</a> Always.
        </p>
        
        <p id="housebled">
            After a few dozens of this kind of courses (and of course, always working with some online reference) I realized I still wasn't ready to actually build anything. I wasn't comfortable with the things I knew, <q>feeling like there was some kind</q>.
